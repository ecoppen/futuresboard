# futuresboard
A python (3.7+) based scraper and dashboard to monitor the performance of your Binance or Bybit Futures account.<br>
<sub>Note: A local sqlite3 database `config/futures.db` will be created and automatically updated by the scraper every 5 minutes.</sub>

[Guide to setting up futuresboard and passivbot](https://www.futuresboard.xyz/)

## Getting started

- Create a fresh new API on Binance or Bybit, with only read rights.
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ecoppen/futuresboard.git`
- Navigate to the futuresboard directory: `cd futuresboard`
- Install dependencies `python -m pip install .`. For developing, `python -m pip install -e .[dev]`
- Copy `config/config.json.example` to `config/config.json` and add your new api key and secret: `nano config.json`
- Collect your current trades by running `futuresboard --scrape-only`. If you want to monitor the weight usage (see below).
- By default, when launching the futuresboard web application, a separate thread is also started to continuously collect new trades.
  Alternatively, setup the scraper on a crontab or alternative to keep the database up-to-date: `crontab -e` then `*/5 * * * * futuresboard --scrape-only` (example is every 5 minutes, change to your needs)
  In this case, don't forget to pass `--disable-auto-scraper`.
- Start a screen or alternative if you want the webserver to persist: `screen -S futuresboard`
- Start the futuresboard web application `futuresboard`
- Navigate to the IP address shown e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. These settings can be changed by passing `--host` and/or `--port` when running the above command

Currently only Binance and Bybit Futures are supported - as those are supported by passivbot.

## API weight usage - Binance

- Reminder: Binance API allows you to consume up to `1200 weight / minute / IP`.
- Account: Fetching account information costs `5` weight per run
- Income: Fetching income information costs `30` weight per 1000 (initial run will build database, afterwards only new income will be fetched)
- Orders: Fetching open order information costs `40` weight per run
- The scraper will sleep for a minute when the rate exceeds `800 within a minute`

## API weight usage - Bybit
- Account/Income/Positions: Fetching account information or positions costs `1` weight per run with a maximum combination allowed of `120/min`. Income can be fetched in batches of 50 (initial run will build database, afters only new income will be fetched)
- Orders: Fetching open order information costs `1` weight per symbol with a maximum allowed of `600/min`
- The scraper will sleep for a minute when the rate exceeds `100 within a minute`

## Customising the dashboard
The `/config/config.json` file allows you to customise the look and feel of your dashboard as follows:
- `AUTO_SCRAPE_INTERVAL` is set to 300 seconds, this value can be adjusted between `60` and `3600`
- `NAVBAR_TITLE` changes the branding in the top left of the navigation (see below)
- `NAVBAR_BG` changes the colour of the navigation bar, acceptable values are: `bg-primary`, `bg-secondary`, `bg-success`, `bg-danger`, `bg-warning`, `bg-info` and the default `bg-dark`
- `PROJECTIONS` changes the percentage values on the projections page. `1.003` equates to `0.3%` daily and `1.01` equates to `1%` daily.

For example, setting `"NAVBAR_TITLE": "Custom title"` and `"NAVBAR_BG": "bg-primary",` would result in:

## Multiple Configs
The `/directories.json` file allows you to add a list of different config files.
- Each `config.json` file needs to be in its own `/config` directory. The database file will be generated and saved in the same folder.
- Example: `/config/config.json` is the default config. We'll add `/coolconfig02/config.json` and `/coolerconfig03/config.json`. Following that we'll need to copy `directories.example.json` to `directories.json` and edit its contents to match the 2 new config directories we've made. The file should look like this:
```
[
  {
    "name":"Config",
    "directory":"config"
  },
  {
    "name":"My Cool Config",
    "directory":"coolconfig02"
  },
  {
    "name":"Cooler Config",
    "directory":"coolerconfig03"
  }
]
```
- It is only from the main page of the futuresboard that you'll be able to switch between configurations.
- Use with caution, there might be some scraper related bugs, this feature isn't yet fully tested.
